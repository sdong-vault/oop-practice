# oop-practice

* Put reference material for folks to self-learn (and bug folks for funding)
* Add folders with the same project and levels of OOP
* Add references to codebase with good examples of OOP usage
* Also encourage folks to do a Zoom call to live code refactoring shenanigans
* Notion docs or READMEs for reference material?
  * Notion: live changes, prettier to format, closer to best practices docs
  * README: version control, put in same place as the code itself
